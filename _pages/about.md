Hi! This is Peter's home on the web! Welcome!

Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Accounting at National University of Singapore (NUS). My research interests include Corporate Governance, the application of Machine Learning, Textual Mining, Causal Inference, and Chinese Market. I hope to anatomize the flux of financial information in the capital market, apprehending the voice delivered by capital flow.

Personal Hobbies
------
I am a classical music amateur (especially Chopin, Debussy, Tchaikovsky, and Beethoven). I enjoy playing some classical pieces of Chopin, e.g., Nocturnes Op.9 No.1., Andante Spianato. I love his use of a more freely flowing rhythm, song-like melody in the right hand, and strongly emotional expression. My favorite pianist is Krystian Zimerman and Yujia Wang. Now, I am striving for the Sonata in D for two pianos, K.448, composed by Mozart, but I need another person and piano.
